  "description": "This is a toy problem for practice with machine learning: * a little triangle \"racer\" is traveling through space * there are blocks in its way... it needs to maneuver to avoid collisions * It's controls are thrust left and thrust right (acceleration.x). It's velocity.y is constant. * It's sensors are an array of distance sensors spread out at equal angles (like a fan). * It must learn to avoid the blocks by adjusting its neural net parameters over multiple runs.",
